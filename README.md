# EduFund - Decentralized Education Crowdfunding
Hello! This is our final project for the Blockchain 1 course. EduFund is a DApp that helps people raise money for educational goals (like courses, books, or tuition) using the Ethereum network.

#The Idea
We wanted to create a transparent way for students to get support. When someone donates test ETH, they automatically receive our project's EDU tokens as a reward.

# Tech Stack
Blockchain: Solidity & Hardhat

Frontend: JavaScript (React), CSS

Library: Ethers.js

Wallet: MetaMask

Network: Sepolia Testnet

# Features
Connect Wallet: Easy login with MetaMask.

Dashboard: Check your current test ETH and EDU token balances.

Create Campaign: Anyone can start a fund with a title, a goal in ETH, and a deadline.

Campaign Progress: Visual progress bars showing how much has been raised.

Rewards: Supporters get EDU tokens minted automatically to their wallets.
